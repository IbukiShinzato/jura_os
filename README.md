# jura_os

A minimal operating system built with Rust, originally based on ["Writing an OS in Rust"](https://os.phil-opp.com/).  
I plan to extend it with additional features.

## 🌲 Why "jura_os"?

The name **"Jura"** comes from the **Jura Forest** in *That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime (転生したらスライムだった件)*.  
Just like the Jura Forest was a land full of potential, this OS is a playground for experimentation and growth!

## 🚀 Build and Run Instructions
